Ns2 is an open source communications network simulator, primarily used in research and teaching. Ns2 provides substantial support for simulation of TCP, routing and multicast protocols over wired and wireless networks. Even though Ns2 is a widely used powerful simulator, it lacks a way to measure network that are used to assess reliability and performance metrics (e.g. the number of packets transferred from source to destination, the delay in packets, packet loss etc.) and it does not analyse the trace files it produces. The data obtained from the simulations is not straightforward to analyse. Ns2 is still unable to provide any data analysis statistics or graphics as requested. Moreover, the analysis of the Ns2 trace file using any software scripts requires further steps by a developer to do data processing and then produce graphical outputs
